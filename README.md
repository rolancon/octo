# Octo
Mini language to express an octal numbering system

The 8 digits of the Octo octal numbering system are called:
*
 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
ney mow zay baw vey low day gaw
*

*n-*, *m-*, *z-*, *b-*, *v-*, *l-*, *d-* and *g-* are pronounced as in Engish.

*-ey* is pronounced as *-ay* in d*ay*
*-ow* is pronounced as *-ow* in l*ow*
*-ay* is pronounced as *-y* in wh*y*
*-aw* is pronounced as *-ow* in h*ow*

## Internal structure of the sounds of the digits
The sounds of the digits have been constructed in such a way that they represent internal structure and relations whereas they are still sound dissimilar enough not to be confused during casual speech.

The structure and relations are as follow:
- All even numbers end in a *y* sound, all odd numbers end in a *w* sound. *ey* is alternated with *ay*, and *ow* is alternated with *aw* to prevent similar-sounding digits.
- The lower half of the digits (0-3) has exactly the same pattern as the higher half of the digits (4-7): *-ey, -ow, -ay, -aw*.
- Digit 0 (ney) evokes older English *nay*, digit 1 (mow) evokes Greek prefix *mono*; the first two digits are also the only ones which start with a nasal sound (*n-* and *m-*).
- Digits 2 (zay) and 4 (vey) both start with a sibilant (*z-* and *v-*), since 4 is the double of 2.
- Digits 3 (baw) and 6 (day) both start with a stop (*b-* and *d-*), since 6 is the double of 3.
- Digits 2 (zaw) and 6 (day) both start with a dental (*z-* and *d-*), since 6 is the triple of 2.
- Digits 3 (baw) and 4 (vey) both start with a labial (*b-* and *v-*), since together they add up to the highest digit (7).
- The prime digits 5 (low) and 7 (gaw) which cannot be derived from or related to the other digits start with distinct types of phonetic sounds: a lateral (*l-*) and a guttural stop (*g-*). 

## Higher numbers

Numbers bigger than 1 digit can be expressed by adding *-ni* (pronounced *-nee*), which is derived from *-ney* (0), to a base digit expressing the number of 0's in the number (i.e., how big the number is); this base is then added to the actual number, which represents the multiplier for that base. Example:
10: mow-mowni
means one times ten, where mowni actually means one 0 (10 has one 0).

To have more than one non-zero digit in a number just append them from highest to lowest, representing addition. Example:
11: mow-mowni mow
means (one times ten) plus one.
In compound numbers the stress falls on the first syllable, e.g., in *zay-mowni* (20) the *zay* is stressed.

The first 8 numbers are actually shortened versions of the full versions which add *-neyni* to the base (meaning zero 0's); since that distinction is unnecessary it is dropped. 
0: ney(-neyni)
1: mow(-neyni)

To express even higher numbers (octal *100000000* and above) use *-mu* (pronounced *-moo*), which is derived from *-mow* (1), to the base digit, starting at *ney*. Example: 
100000000: *mow-neymu* (neymow)
7777777777777777 (16 digits) is the highest possible number than can be expressed in Octo this way (more than 200 trillion in decimal).
